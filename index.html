          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I have always loved how the power of a story can bring you inside an entirely new world. This inspired me to study theatre as a child and pursue directing in college, where I lead actors and designers through the process of creating a brand new experience.
            <br /><br />In my many jobs in the tourism industry, from giving guided tours of historic houses to assisting Disney characters in their meet and greets, I have seen how the smallest details can help make an experience more immersive and memorable.
            <br /><br />By applying these skills to web design and development, I am able to make informed choices that will add to the user experience, and create websites with that same sense of storytelling.</p>
